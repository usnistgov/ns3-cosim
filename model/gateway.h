/**
 * An abstract base class that maintains a socket connection with a server to exchange data during simulation runtime.
 * The pure virtual Gateway::DoInitialize and Gateway::DoUpdate functions must be implemented in a derived class to
 * specify how data received from the server is processed. The purpose of this class is to handle time management,
 * turning the ns-3 simulator into a discrete-time simulation that operates in lock-step with the server.
 *
 * All packets, sent and received, are strings with the format "v1_v2_.._vn|", where:
 *  1) _ is a user-specified delimiter that separates elements within the message (see the constructor)
 *  2) | is a user-specified delimiter that indicates the end of the message (see the constructor)
 *  3) v1 .. vn are string elements that contain any value excluding the delimiters from 1 and 2
